## About Tasty Bytes
Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 in the midst of the Covid Pandemic. The world wanted
inspiration so we decided to provide it. We started life as a search engine for recipes, helping
people to find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home.
Now, over two years on, we are a fully fledged business. For a monthly subscription we will put
together a full meal plan to ensure you and your family are getting a healthy, balanced diet
whatever your budget. Subscribe to our premium plan and we will also deliver the ingredients
to your door.
## The Task
At the moment, the product manager selects a favorite recipe from a selection and display that on the homepage. It was noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if I pick a popular recipe. But I don’t know how to decide if a recipe will be popular. More traffic means more subscriptions so this is really important to the company.
The task to the team:
- Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic?
- Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time?
We need to make a decision on this soon, so I need you to present your results to me by the end of the month. Whatever your results, what do you recommend we do next? Look forward to seeing your presentation.
## Data Information
The product manager has tried to make this easier for us and provided data for each recipe, as well as whether there was high traffic when the recipe was featured on the home page. As you will see, they haven’t given us all of the information they have about each recipe. I will let you decide how to process it, just make sure you include all your decisions in your report. Don’t forget to double check the data really does match what they say - it might not.
## Written Report

  ● Data validation:\
